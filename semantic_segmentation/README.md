# Semantic Segmentation for Colorization
Here we will experiment with using Semantic Segmentation to solve image colorization problem using Deep Neural Networks. Following topics will be discussed in this repository.

1. How to implement a simple semantic segmentation model using DCNN
2. Implement a way to fuse features or outputs extracted from the Semantic segmentation model to the Colorization model.
3. Ways to improve the accuracy of Segmentation.
4. Coming soon.....
